      <description>Patrick Collison has a great list of people quickly accomplishing ambitious things. Inspired by that, I created a page of impressive things accomplished by small teams.
  Instagram had 13 employees when they were acquired by Facebook for $1 billion. They had 30 millions users at the time. Source
  Mojang (the company behind Minecraft) had 37 employees when they were acquired by Microsoft for $2.5 billion. At that time, Mojang had revenue of about $290 million annually with profits of over $100 million.</description>

      <description>I love a good plate of fish and chips. I also love a good chance to compare the software development field to a completely separate industry. It&amp;rsquo;s a great way to find solutions to problems that have been solved decades ago in other fields (genealogy for example) and it helps to keep me grounded in the good &amp;lsquo;ol practical reality.
I came across a great example of this today while watching Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives with Guy Fieri.</description>
